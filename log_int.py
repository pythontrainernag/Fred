# Logical operators
# and, or, not
# and, or are binary operators because it requires two values to action
# not is unary operator because it requires single value
# while converting integers to boolean, all numbers except zero will be converted as True and zero will be converted as False
# Generally logical operators will accept only boolean values as input.
# In case of python, Even if I provide integers then python will Automatically convert them to boolean and perform the action
# Even though the outputs and inputs are in integers, we have understand them in boolean format only

print("5 and 3 is", 5 and 3)# both inputs are True, so output is also True
print("5 and 0 is", 5 and 0)# 5 is True, 0 is False. So output is False(0)
print("5 or 0 is", 5 or 0)
print("0 or 0 is", 0 or 0)
