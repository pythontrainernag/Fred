Program: A Set of instructions giving to perform particular task

As a human we can understand only some english format
But system can understand only binary language( 1 and 0 )

Now I will 3rd person who knows telugu as well as english. He will be working as converter, A person whenever speaks in telugu, he converts to english and vice versa


We need a converter to convert English format language(C, Python, Java) to Binary language. This action can be performed by either compiler or interpreter.

Programming language and scripting language

The languages whichever uses compiler to convert to binary format are called programming languages

The languages whichever uses interpreter to convert to binary format are called scripting languages


programming languages: It uses compiler. A compiler is a two step process. 1. compilation(It converts to Binary format(compiled code)) 2. execution(executes the binary format and shows the output)

The compiled is always platform dependent 
py ---> pf independent 
pyc(compiled files) ---> pf dependent

I am developing an application like notepad++. I sold it to other person.
In order to get it executed I have to provide source code.
Other person is very good at programming. He identified the bugs. He has gone through the SC. He modified the source to avoid bugs and then he released a new product like otherpad++ 


Scripting Language: Single step process
No concept of compiled files 
A single step will always converts to binary format and executes 

In real time most applications will always use the combination of programming and scripting language

Why python? Features of the programming/Scripting language 

Open source: You can use it for Free. By Using you can develop any application and sell them. You can also get the source and modify it as per your needs.

open office -----> MS office
CentOS  ----> RHEL

I need to develop an application. I had two employees.
It will take 50 days to develop
It will take 25 days to develop 
The customer will pay me $ 10000 for completion of application
If I go for non open source, licence cost is $ 3000 and $ 2000
If I go open source, salary will be $ 4000
If he give us 3 months, I will go for open source 
If he give us 1 month, I have to go non open source 

2. Easy to develop/maintain:

print "Hello World"

class Myclass {

	public static void main(){
		system.out.print("Hello World")
	
	}

}

3. Large standard library: why python is being sued in Data science/ Machine learning? 
I want to connect a remote machine and execute a simple command
Here I will use a library called paramiko 
import paramiko 
paramiko.connect(ip/machine)
By Using ML, I will find a solution and this solution has to be display in UI 
python has libraries related to ML and it has libraries related to web development(UI)
If I consider R language it has libraries only related to ML 

4. Embeddable/extendable: 
c language is more efficient(95%) and security(95%)
Java is more secured(99%) and efficient(90%)

Python is less efficient and more secured 
c + python ---> cython
Java + python ----> jython 
.net + python ----> ironpython 





Identifiers:
Identifier is the naming convention of the python object where python object can be a variable/Function/class/ Any name in a program 
Rules of an identifier:
1. It should contain numbers, alphabets and _ only 
2. It shouldn't start with numbers 
3. It shouldn't contain only numbers 
4. Length of the identifier/name: length can infinite but it always recommended to provide a valid name 
5. Using predefines library names: I can use predefined names but it's recommended 
6. we cannot use keywords as a name/identifier
keyword?  ---> By showing the dog, Can I say it as a cat?
In a programming also, we are having some reserved words. This words are not nothing but keywords. 


Variables, datatypes and operators, conditional statement and loops

Variables: named memory locations
A variable is used to hold some values that is necessary for our programming


Data Type: It indicates what are the various operations(addition, multiplication, comparion etc.) we can perform with that particular data 

Python code can be executed in interactive or script mode;

Interactive mode: First I will trigger up the interpreter and I will execute the python commands

Script mode: All python commands(lines/codes) to be executed are saved in file with extension .py. This file will be sent as argument to python interpreter.

How to send the data/values from python program to console


Operators:
Arthematic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %(modulos/Remainder), **
Relational operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
Logical operators: and, or, not 
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, similarly every arthematic operator with =
membership operators: in, not in 
Identity operators: is, is not
